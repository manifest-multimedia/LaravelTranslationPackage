## Usage

Our package is designed to be user-friendly, requiring minimal configurations to get started. Here's a quick guide on how to use the Laravel Multi-Language Translation Package:

### Step 1: Configuration

The package comes with sensible default settings, so in most cases, you don't need to configure anything. However, if you want to customize certain aspects of the translation process, you can do so easily in the configuration file.

### Step 2: Translation

To start translating your application or website, you can use the provided artisan commands or access the translation functionalities programmatically from your code. The package will automatically detect the language strings in your project and offer translation options.

### Step 3: Human Review (Optional)

While our package ensures high accuracy in translations, you have the option to enable human review for critical or sensitive translations. With just a simple configuration, you can leverage our human translation capabilities to ensure absolute precision.
